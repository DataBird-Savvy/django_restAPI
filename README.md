# Django REST Framework Learning Project

This repository is my first hands-on practice with **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
I am exploring how to create a Django project and app, build APIs, work with models, and implement basic authentication and pagination.

---

## What I Learned

- Setting up a Django project and creating apps
- Defining **models** with **ForeignKey relationships**
- Creating APIs using DRF serializers and views
- Implementing **Token Authentication** in the `people` app
- Trying out **JWT Authentication** in the `users` app
- Adding **Pagination** to API responses
- Performing basic CRUD operations
